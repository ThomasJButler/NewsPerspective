# NewsPerspective Learning Guide

A simple explanation of how NewsPerspective works and what it does.

## What Problem Does This Solve?

News headlines are often written to grab attention using negative, sensational language. This creates doomscrolling and emotional fatigue. NewsPerspective fixes this by:

1. Detecting negative or clickbait headlines
2. Rewriting them in a more balanced, factual tone
3. Preserving all the facts whilst removing the sensationalism

## How It Works (Simple Overview)

### The Pipeline

```
News Sources → Fetch → Analyse → Rewrite → Store → Search/Browse
```

**Step 1: Fetch News**
- Connects to NewsAPI (currently)
- Fetches up to 1000 articles per day
- Supports pagination (100 articles per request)
- Mixes different sources (general news + sports)

**Step 2: Analyse Headlines**
- Uses Azure AI Language to detect sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)
- Identifies problematic phrases (crisis, scandal, threatens, etc.)
- Calculates confidence score (0-100%)
- Extracts key entities (people, places, events)

**Step 3: Rewrite (If Needed)**
- Only rewrites if:
  - Negative sentiment > 60% confidence, OR
  - Contains problematic sensational language, OR
  - Negative score > positive score AND > 40%
- Uses Azure OpenAI to rewrite in calmer, factual tone
- Preserves all factual information
- Stores both original and rewritten versions

**Step 4: Store in Azure Search**
- Uploads to searchable index
- Includes metadata (source, date, tone, confidence, reason)
- Enables fast semantic search

**Step 5: Browse and Search**
- Streamlit web interface for visual browsing
- Command-line tool for quick searches
- Filter by source, date, tone, confidence

## Key Components Explained

### 1. batch_processor.py (The Workhorse)

**What it does:**
Processes large volumes of articles (up to 500) in manageable batches.

**Why batches?**
- Prevents API rate limits
- Allows progress tracking
- Enables failure recovery
- Spreads load over time

**Configuration:**
- `BATCH_TOTAL_ARTICLES`: How many articles to process (default: 500)
- `BATCH_SIZE`: Articles per batch (default: 20)
- `BATCH_DELAY`: Seconds between batches (default: 10)

**Example:**
```bash
# Process 500 articles in batches of 20
python batch_processor.py
```

### 2. run.py (The Simple Runner)

**What it does:**
Processes a small number of articles (up to 20) in one go.

**When to use it:**
- Testing the system
- Quick updates
- Development/debugging
- Small-scale runs

**Example:**
```bash
# Process 20 articles quickly
python run.py
```

### 3. azure_ai_language.py (The Analyst)

**What it does:**
Analyses text for sentiment, entities, and key phrases.

**How it analyses:**
1. Sends text to Azure AI Language service
2. Gets back sentiment scores (positive/neutral/negative percentages)
3. Identifies entities (people, places, organisations)
4. Extracts key phrases
5. Has fallback mode if service unavailable

**Why confidence scores matter:**
- 80%+ = Very confident
- 60-79% = Moderately confident
- <60% = Low confidence (might skip rewriting)

### 4. azure_document_intelligence.py (The Deep Reader)

**What it does:**
Extracts full article content from URLs, not just headlines.

**Why this is useful:**
- Compares headline to actual article content
- Detects clickbait (headline doesn't match article)
- Finds problematic quotes in the body text
- Provides justification for rewrites

**What it extracts:**
- Full text content
- Headlines and subheadlines
- Paragraphs
- Key quotes with context
- Structure analysis (word count, sections)

### 5. logger_config.py (The Tracker)

**What it does:**
Tracks everything that happens during processing.

**What it logs:**
- API calls made
- Articles processed
- Rewrites successful/failed
- Errors and warnings
- Performance metrics

**Where logs go:**
- `logs/news_perspective_YYYYMMDD.log` - All activity
- `logs/errors.log` - Errors only
- Console output - Real-time updates

**Stats tracked:**
- Articles fetched
- Articles processed
- Rewrites successful
- API errors
- Success rates
- Duration

### 6. search.py (The CLI Tool)

**What it does:**
Command-line tool for searching the indexed articles.

**Commands:**
```bash
# Show latest articles
python search.py

# Search by keyword
python search.py --keyword "technology"

# Recent articles (last 24 hours)
python search.py --recent 24

# Filter by source
python search.py --source "BBC"

# Show source summary
python search.py --sources

# Test connection
python search.py --test
```

### 7. web_app.py (The Visual Interface)

**What it does:**
Beautiful web interface for browsing rewritten headlines.

**Features:**
- Search with filters
- "Good News Only" toggle (show only rewrites)
- Statistics dashboard
- Article cards with:
  - Original vs rewritten comparison
  - Tone indicators
  - Confidence scores
  - Rewrite reasoning
  - Links to full articles

**How to run:**
```bash
streamlit run web_app.py
```

## Azure Services Explained

### Azure OpenAI

**What it is:**
Microsoft's hosted version of OpenAI's GPT models.

**What we use it for:**
Rewriting headlines from negative to positive tone.

**Model used:**
gpt-35-turbo-instruct (fast, cost-effective for completions)

**How it works:**
1. We send a prompt: "Rewrite this headline in a calm, factual tone"

## Decision Logic Explained

### When Does It Rewrite?

```
IF negative sentiment > 60% confidence
   → REWRITE (high confidence negative)

OR IF positive sentiment > 80% confidence
   → SKIP (already positive, no need)

OR IF headline contains problematic phrases
   (crisis, scandal, threatens, slams, outrage, etc.)
   → REWRITE (sensational language detected)

OR IF negative score > positive score AND negative > 40%
   → REWRITE (leans negative)

ELSE
   → SKIP (neutral or unclear)

AND ONLY IF confidence >= 60%
   (don't rewrite if we're not confident)
```

### What Style to Use?

```
IF tone is SENSATIONAL or NEGATIVE
   → Use "calm, factual" style
   → Remove emotional language
   → Keep just the facts

ELSE
   → Use "slightly more positive" style
   → Maintain balance
   → Add constructive framing
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Missing required environment variables"**
- Check .env file exists
- Verify all keys are set
- Check for typos in variable names

**"NewsAPI rate limit hit"**
- Free tier: 500 requests/day
- Wait 60 seconds (automatic)
- Consider upgrading plan

**"Azure Search error 404"**
- Index doesn't exist
- Create index in Azure Portal
- Check index name in .env

**"Azure OpenAI error 429"**
- Rate limit exceeded
- Wait for retry (uses Retry-After header)
- Consider increasing quota

**"No articles fetched"**
- Check NEWS_API_KEY is valid
- Verify internet connection
- Check NewsAPI status

**"Sentiment analysis unavailable"**
- System uses fallback mode
- Continues processing with basic detection
- Check Azure AI Language credentials

## Best Practices

### Running in Production

**Start small:**
```bash
# Test with 10 articles first
MAX_ARTICLES_PER_RUN=10 python run.py
```

**Monitor logs:**
```bash
# Watch live logs
tail -f logs/news_perspective_*.log
```

**Check for errors:**
```bash
# View error log
cat logs/errors.log
```

**Verify uploads:**
```bash
# Test search connection
python search.py --test
```

### Cost Optimisation

**Azure OpenAI:**
- Only rewrite when needed (confidence checks)
- Use cheaper models for simpler tasks
- Cache common rewrites

**Azure AI Language:**
- Batch sentiment analysis when possible
- Use fallback mode for low-priority content
- Stay within free tier limits

**Azure Search:**
